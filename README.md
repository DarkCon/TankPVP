# Tanks PVP
Simple game for researching ECS in Unity with multiplayer for maximum 4 players.

This is my first work with ECS, so the use of this project as an example is not recommended.

### Frameworks
- [Morpeh](https://github.com/X-Crew/Morpeh) for ECS
- [Photon](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/pun-2-free-119922) for Network

### Build And Run
For Photon work you need set your own `AppIdRealtime` in [PhotonServerSettings.asset](Assets/Photon/PhotonUnityNetworking/Resources/PhotonServerSettings.asset).

For more information go to [Photon manual](https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/v2/getting-started/initial-setup)
